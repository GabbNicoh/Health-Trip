# Health-Trip
A submission for HackFest 2020: Online by ByteMe.

This project was made with Android Studio.
We used a Google Maps SDK API for Android.

We've blocked the current API key because it charged payment once it was posted on Github.
You would need an API that is connected to a credit card to run the services.
  
  You can replace the API which is located at google_maps_api.xml and RetrofitMaps.java that has the variable YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
  
Firebase was used for the database of the user profile.
Figma was used in prototyping and presenting the application.
