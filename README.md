# Health-Trip
A submission for HackFest 2020: Online by ByteMe.

This project was made with Android Studio.
We used a Google Maps SDK API for Android.

We've blocked the current API key because it charged payment once it was posted on Github.

Firebase was used for the database of the user profile.
Figma was used in prototyping and presenting the application.
